# Important

There are several websites in this lab's repository:

1. Part I (part1.html)
2. Part II (part2.html)
3. Part III (part3.html)

Each **website** has it's on CSS file. A **website** should only ever have **one** CSS file.

Do not create separate CSS files for different pages for Project 2; do not create a mobile CSS file and desktop CSS file for Project 2; your Project 2 should have _exactly_ **one** CSS file: styles/site.css.
